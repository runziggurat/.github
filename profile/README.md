Like the multi-stepped pyramids of antiquity, Ziggurat stands to provide multiple layers of stability for your peer-to-peer network. By reverse-engineering the network protocol and using lightweight "synthetic" nodes, Ziggurat provides blockchain node developers with the foundation of reliability, performance, and scalability needed to realize their true potential.

# Network Coverage

Our coverage so far includes ZCash, Aleo, Algorand, and the XRP Ledger. More are on the way. The table below illustrates whether a network is covered (💚), WIP (🚧), or not covered (❌)

## Coverage Details

Ziggurat started with the three single-node layers of testing - Conformance, Performance, and Resistance (CPR). However, we are now exploring (and in some cases performing) network-wide analysis and testing.

## Single Node Tests

The CPR test suite has become a staple of any Ziggurat implementation:

1. **Conformance** to the network specification
   1. Does a network spec exist?[^1]
   2. Do all clients exhibit the same networking behavior?
   3. Do any inconsistencies cause incompatibility between clients?
2. **Performance** under scale
   1. Does your node experience slowdowns under increased load?
   2. ...heavy load? _Very_ heavy load?
   3. What factors of your node's engineering lead to performance bottlenecks?
3. **Resistance** to bad actors.
   1. How does your node respond to unexpected messages?
   2. Does your node inadvertendly allow malicious or unexpected behaviors?

## Network-wide

1. Network Crawler
   1. How many nodes are running on your network?
   2. How many are running _well_?
   3. What versions of clients and network protocols are out there?
   4. What other analytics can we gather from the peer-to-peer network?
2. Data analytics and visualization
3. Data flow for network analysis: IPS and network visualization

<!-- 2. Testnet Red-Teaming (coming soon!) -->
<!-- 2. DoS protection (coming soon!) -->

## Development Cycle

Ziggurat is compatible with networks at any phase of deployment. For example - the CPR tests can be run during development or pre-deployment, and the network-wide tests can be run on devnet, testnet, or even mainnet.
